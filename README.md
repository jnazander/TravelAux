Location recognition and retrieval app for Android. Originally writtn by me in 2013.

This app allows you to take picture of a sign of a store or any other business, which will then be processed by Tesseract OCR engine to read its text. It will then be searched in any of your selected location services (Google places, FourSquare, Facebook places, etc...) with just one click! You can then read its description, read & write reviews and do many more things.
